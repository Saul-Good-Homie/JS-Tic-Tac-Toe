In this project, I am creating a simple book library that allows users to enter Book objects with the properties of: Title, Author, Page count and read/not read. The purpose of this project is to practice using javascript to create and store objects as well as present the objects in the DOM.

This is a Javascript project from [The Odin Project]()
